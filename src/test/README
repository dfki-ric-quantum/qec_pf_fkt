# Testing the Partition Function Calculation

## Overview
This directory contains tests for verifying the correct operation of the partition function calculation code which will be executed when calling `make`.

## Test files
The tests receive hardcoded interactions stored in `test/interactionsGaussian` and the corresponding expected partition functions results under `test/expectedResults`. Additonally, one test checks whether the couplings set by error probabilities in the truncated Gaussian noise model are calculated correctly.

## Running Tests
Run `make` and test will be executed after building the binaries which includes:
1. Run the isingZToTxt and isingGeneratorRandomBond binaries for test parameters
2. Compare the output to expected results
3. Report if there are differences
4. Clean the run results
