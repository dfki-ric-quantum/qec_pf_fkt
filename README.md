# Partition function calculation for logical failure estimation of toric code in [1]
This repository contains a modified version of [`isingZ`](https://github.com/a-alan-middleton/IsingPartitionFn) which was originally developed by Creighton K. Thomas (creightonthomas@gmail.com) and A. Alan Middleton (aam@syr.edu). The modifications of this repository aim at generating large sample sets of partition function estimates for a uniform disorder distribution and a truncated Gaussian disorder model.
The finite temperature and Ising couplings are chosen to fit the statistical mechanics mapping of stabilizer codes to relate the partition functions to logical error curves as explained in detail in [1].

## Notes on Authors
This repository was created by the authors of [1], Leon Wichette, Hans Hohenfeld, Elie Mounzer and Linnea Grans-Samuelsson, to utilize `isingZ` for the simulation of partition function decoding on the toric code.

Our changes include:
- **Interaction and partition function output to `.txt`**: Enables large scale experimental setup.
- **Disorder sampling**: The generator now supports both a **uniform** distibution and **truncated Gaussian** disorder distribution.
- **Nishimori condition**: The temperature and interaction strengths are determined by the Nishimori condition to enable the statistical mechanical mapping of stabilizer codes.
- **Simplified codebase**: Unused components have been removed to streamline the codebase.
- **Packing of results**: A script called `combine_to_hdf5.py` was added to store results in a single file which acts as input for the post processing pipeline.

For scientific or reproducibility inquiries, please refer to the arXiv paper above or contact the authors listed therein.

## Brief description of input format and usage
```text
Conventions for input format for Ising samples:
 See sample files in src/test/ for examples of input files.
 These files include system size and a list of bond weights, two
   bond weights per spin. The weights are indexed by spin coordinates
   and bond directions.

## Quick Setup and Dependencies

To successfully build and run this project, ensure your environment has access to:
- `g++` compiler with support for **C++17** (e.g., version 7 or newer)
- GNU Scientific Library (GSL)
- GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP)
- GNU Make

You can install necessary dependencies by running:
```
sudo ./scripts/install-deps.sh
```

Activate the created virtual environment:
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Build the binaries for the partition function calculation by running from the project root:
```
make
```

The build process runs additionally some simple tests to verify proper building.

## Usage Instructions

The workflow consists of three steps:
1. Generate Ising interactions using `isingGeneratorRandomBond`
2. Calculate partition functions using `isingZToTxt`
3. Pack results in HDF5 format using `combine_to_hdf5.py`

### Step 1: Generate Ising Interactions

```bash
./build/generator_random_bond/isingGeneratorRandomBond Lx Ly seed probability output_directory [std_deviation]
```

Parameters:
- `Lx`, `Ly`: Lattice dimensions (integers)
- `seed`: Random number generator seed (integer)
- `probability`: Probability parameter for bond generation (double, 0.0 to 0.5)
- `output_directory`: Base directory for output files
- `std_deviation`: (Optional) Standard deviation for Gaussian noise distribution

Example:
```bash
./build/generator_random_bond/isingGeneratorRandomBond 5 5 42 0.1 ./data
```

This generates a 5Ã—5 lattice with probability 0.1 of flipping a bond and saves it to:
`./data/interactionsGaussian/0.100000/5/5/0.000000/42/interaction_lattice.txt`

With truncated Gaussian distributed coupling flipping probability with mean probability 0.1 and standard deviation 0.05:
```bash
./build/generator_random_bond/isingGeneratorRandomBond 5 5 42 0.1 ./data 0.05
```

### Step 2: Calculate Partition Functions

```bash
./build/Z_to_txt/isingZToTxt precision Lx Ly seed probability temperature output_directory [std_deviation]
```

Parameters:
- `precision`: Bits of precision for calculations (e.g., 512, 1024, 4096)
- `Lx`, `Ly`: Same lattice dimensions as used in Step 1
- `seed`: Same seed as used in Step 1
- `probability`: Same probability as used in Step 1
- `temperature`: Temperature factor measured in units of Nishimori temperature
- `output_directory`: Same base directory as used in Step 1
- `std_deviation`: (Optional) Same standard deviation as used in Step 1

Example:
```bash
./build/Z_to_txt/isingZToTxt 4096 5 5 42 0.1 1.0 ./data
```

This reads the interaction file and outputs the partition functions to:
`./data/resultsGaussian/0.100000/0.000000/5/5/1.000000/4096/42/Z.txt`

With Gaussian noise:
```bash
./build/Z_to_txt/isingZToTxt 4096 5 5 42 0.1 1.0 ./data 0.05
```

The output text file contains four tab-separated partition function values that represent four different boundary conditions of the spin lattice:
 - (periodic, periodic)
 - (periodic, anti periodic)
 - (anti periodic, periodic)
 - (anti periodic, anti periodic)


### Step 3: Combine results

To handle the results easier it may be useful for you to pack the generated results in a structured way into a HDF5 file. THis can be achieved by calling:

```bash
python scripts/combine_to_hdf5.py results_dir output_file_name
```
Parameters:
- `results_dir`: The directory the results directory was created in (same directory the algorithm scripts were executed with)
- `output_file_name`: The name of the output HDF5 file

Example:
```bash
python scripts/combine_to_hdf5.py ./data results.h5
```
This reads the results from `./data/resultsGaussian` and stores the content in `results.h5`.
